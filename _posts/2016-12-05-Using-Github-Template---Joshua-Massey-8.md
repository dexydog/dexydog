    <td>I learnt by having a PowerPoint presented to my class by a teacher who had come in. He explained that computational thinking is when you think in logical steps to solve problems and tasks. You can use 4 methods to use computational thinking. These are:
Decompose - Breaking down a problem down into smaller pieces.
Pattern Matching - Finding similarities between things.
Abstraction - Pulling out specific differences to make one solution work for multiple problems.
Algorithm - A list of steps you can follow to finish a task.

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was that I did not fully understand these terms in this particular format of computational thinking (logical thinking). I need to work on thinking how these terms come up in other formats that is not CT (computational thinking), and apply these to CT.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will make sure that I apply CT to my everyday learning and problem solving so that I can think in logical ways to help solve more challenging problems. This will improve my learning as I will be able to solve harder and more challenging problems more easily.</td>
