  <tr>
    <td>I learnt how to put work on a memory whilst using a fuze box. This is done by clicking save whilst editing or finished editing code and then scrolling through the folders and add ons and you should come across the name of your disk, drive or whatever it is. You click on this and then name the file and press save. So I guess an effective strategy is to look for the name of your hard drive properly.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think what limited my learning was that before now I kept forgetting to bring a memory stick which meant I needed to start over as I had no proof that I had done the work. So the habit I need to work on is remembering the equipment that I need for my lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will make sure that I remember all the correct equipment for my lessons so that I can save my work so that any progress I make will not have to be done again.</td>
