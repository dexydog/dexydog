**Introduction To E-Safety**

In our latest IT lesson we had an introduction to E-Safety. We learnt not to give out our personal details. This included email addresses, any type of password, phone numbers, home address, and our full name.

This is because people online can hack into our computers and also try to force you to give you things like money by threatening you.
