How was it to create your identity map?

It was quite fun making it. This is because it was fun looking through pictures to choose to put on it.

How did you feel about sharing your map with the rest of class in this way?

It was nice because you got feedback on your maps and they gave you tips on how to improve.

How did it feel to comment on the identity maps?

It was good to comment because you can see other's work and you can also help other people improve.

Did you enjoy this process or would you have rather asked questions and commented directly to the student as we sometimes do during class presentations?

Yes as it less daunting and you don't get asked surprising questions.

How did it feel to get the comments back and read through them? Were there any surprises?

It was very nice to get work commented on. Yes there was a surprise and it was that all the comments were positive.

How is this process different from commenting on something online when you can't see the person?

It is pretty different because you can see the effect your comments have afterwards.

Did your identity map help to create a sense of what you would like to post more of or less of in the future?

Not really because I didn't really specify what I would post in the future.

Are there any other changes you want to make in the media you use based on this activity? 

No because I use media sensibly.

Did these six lessons change how you view social media? If so, how?

Yes because I thought social media was safer than it actually was.

Did the lessons change how you plan on using social media in the future? If so, how?

Yes it did, this is because I planned to use it freely but now I plan use it safely.
