**sport in my life**

Sport has always been a key factor in my life. I have tried many sports in my eleven years in life. Some of my favourites are cricket, rugby, football and athletics. My favourite sports player is Joe Root.

                                                                   ![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/5WyQFeXhO7LufBiZ3hg_img_0.png)
