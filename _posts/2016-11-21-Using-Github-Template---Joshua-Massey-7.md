    <td>We learnt by reading the code in the book like usual and copying into our fuze box editor like usual. But once we hit stage 2 we had to get an electronics kit which included wires and led bulbs. We had to work out how to use them. We learnt how by copying the pictures inside the fuze project manual.

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The things that limited my learning was that we could not work out how these wires LED lights worked and how to use them. This meant we couldn't continue even though the code was correct as we double checked and triple checked it to the manual. We couldn't complete it in the lesson so we still have to work out what to do with that.</td>

    <td>Next time I will have to learn how to get it working correctly. This will mean we can carry on the projects swiftly.
P.S.
