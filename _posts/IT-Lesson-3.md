(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by using the fuze project book, which I now fully understand. It was helpful to read through the code given and type it in word for word and if it didn't work I could look in the explain section on the same page.
In this lesson I Learnt how to make the fuze box ask questions and then once I replied I could make react to my answer. I also learnt how to combine names. E.G. name1+name2 would create name3. So say N1= Harry and N2= Potter N1+N2= Harry Potter.
N=Name

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was that sometimes I would type in name$ as a variable and then the next time I wanted to type in the same variable I would accidently type in Name$. This would stop the code running properly as the variable was not consistent.
So the habit I need to work on is typing the variable exactly the same all the time. This should make the code run through properly.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change the way I type the variables so that I wonâ€™t have to change the code line which will help me work quicker which ultimately leads to more work in the lesson. </td>
