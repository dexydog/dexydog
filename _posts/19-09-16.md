  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Little knowledge about fuze and how it works as I started last week. Pretty okay at setting the fuze box up.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To try and get as many fuze projects finished as possible</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>This week I started on project 1-1 and ended up finishing on project 2-2 which is really good as I only completed one project last week.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I learnt how to change the colour of a word and the background when running a script. I also learnt how to repeat a word and how to have a rest until a next word appears.

  <tr>
    <td>There were some code errors in certain places that we had to change but we managed to in about 1 or 2 attempts each time.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will check over whether the code is spelt wrong and I will also check that if a variable is repeated twice or more it is typed exactly the same each time.</td>
