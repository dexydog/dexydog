In this IT lesson we talked about psychopaths and sociopaths, that psychopaths harm or kill things and feel like a real human but sociopaths don't feel bad at all when he or she kills something. Mr Keen told us a story about at his old school that some children caught a seagull and they ripped its wings off.
