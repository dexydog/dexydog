    <td>I learnt by trying to copy the very unclear pictures provided in the fuze project book. This was very difficult as the pictures were very unclear I am not only blaming my lack of progress due to the very unclear pictures but as I said the pictures in the book were very unclear.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The things that limited my learning were as follows:
The pictures were very unclear
The pictures were very unclear
The pictures were very unclear
As you can see I wrote the same three things down each time this is because all reasons I would've written down all relate back to the same first point: the pictures were very unclear.
The main thing was actually that we couldn't figure out where to put the wires, resistors and LED lights. This was because the pictures were very unclear. I need to work on my vision on where to put things and looking at pictures. I donâ€™t see how that would help much though because the pictures in the book were very unclear.
