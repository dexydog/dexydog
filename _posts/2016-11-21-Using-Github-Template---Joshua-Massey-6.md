    <td>I learnt by going onto W3 Schools which is a great website if you are not sure how to do something in either HTML or SCSS. So basically I just copied the code into my main scss file on GitHub which is really easy and hardly takes anytime which is great. But of course you cannot just type this code in a random place you should always type at the bottom of your main scss file.

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was my snail like speed that I copy things into my main scss file this is really annoying as it means I did not get finished the copying even though we had plenty of time to do this in the lesson, this resulted in more homework.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will try and work quicker in the lesson to make sure I have less homework. This means I can concentrate more on homework for other subjects as well as I.T.</td>
