CHRISTMAS

This christmas holidays I haven't done a lot of things mainly just playing on the XBOX with my brother and dad. The reason we probably did that was because I had a new game called guitar hero. But yesterday we went to watch a rugby match. Wasps Vs Saracens. Saracens won 26-16, not the result I wanted as I?m a Wasp fan. Today I am going to watch Snoopy at the cinema with my brother and dad as you probably would have guessed.
